This is on of the famous project in kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset


In this project I have used NTLK and Spacy library for text cleaning purpose,the to understand the text data I created a more intuitive word cloud using PIL library.To extract feature from the data I used TF-IDF algorithm. On training the Linear SVC I get the accuracy of 99.358%.
